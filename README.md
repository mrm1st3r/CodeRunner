CodeRunner
==========

A small Jump'n'Run game

You're a procrastinating programmer, who has to finish a project today.
To avoid sleeping, you have to collect coffee and avoid beds until your code
is finished.

----------

try to avoid:
- energy falling below 0 (falling asleep)
- energy going up to 10 (dying of coffeine shock)
- touching bugs (getting depressions)

----------

Ironically this is the first project I started more or less early.
